 |             The Masque of the Red Death                         |
 |                  By Edgar Allan Poe                             |
|                                                                  |
 |       The red death had long devastated the country.             |
  |        No pestilence had ever been so fatal, or so hideous.      |
  |      Blood was its Avatar and its seal --                         |
  |          the madness and the horror of blood.                     |
   |     There were sharp pains, and sudden dizziness,                |
    |     and then profuse bleeding at the pores, with dissolution.  |
     |      The scarlet stains upon the body and especially          |
    |        upon the face of the victim, were the pest ban,          |
   |     which shut him out from the sympathy of his fellow-men.       |
  |     And the whole seizure, progress and termination of the illness |
   |       were incidents of half an hour.                             |
   |                                                                  |
